# SpeedReader
Just a small ruby script to help you learn to speed read. It takes a text file and splits it into chunks at the desired rate.

## Usage

```
# ./sr.rb [ words per minute ] [ word group ] [ file ]

$ ruby ./sr.rb 300 5 ./alice-in-wonderland.txt
```

## TODO
Maybe I will turn this into a gem, and add features n stuff

* Show the current wpm and percent complete in the top right
* Enable Pause with space bar
* Speed up/down with arrow keys
